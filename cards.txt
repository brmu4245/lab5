Seriously, when I open a brand-new pack, I get this strange feeling that there’s this
symbiotic relationship between my brain and the cards.
Cards prefer to be in an orderly state of tranquility. When the cards are in order,
my thoughts are in order.
You can see the cards in the new deck order as they come from the factory.
This connection poses a problem. If I were to shuffle these cards,
 My words mixed up become a little.
 Shuffle them more a bit, and words my become confused more even.
 Imagine, can you now, shuffling keep if I understand what able you to anything.
 I digress but.
 Please, a card take.
 Excellent, everyone and show
 Down to face now table, the card, for I’ll put
 You thank
 Said as before, I to cards orderly of prefer in be state and tranquility
 Plus words the cards and my if order in where, much would determine it be card
to missing was easier which.
 Would it, therefore, concentrate I if enough hard I cards force can my words back
into order…
If I concentrate hard enough, I can force my words back into order.
That means if my words are back into order, my thoughts are back into order, and that
means the cards are also back into order.
